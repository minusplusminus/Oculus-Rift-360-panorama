# Oculus-Rift-360-panorama
Openframeworks app for 360 view 

## Installation

Download Openframeworks from: http://openframeworks.cc/download/

clone this repository in your '[Openframeworks]/Apps' folder

Copy your video into the bin/Data folder. See the video example for a resolution reference

## Todo

- Have not tested the head orientation for the DK2, because I don't own a DK2
- Not tested the position of the DK2 video
- Not tested on Visual studio (should not be much work to get it working)
